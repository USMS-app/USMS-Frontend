```javascript
// School data structure
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  code: string,
  address: string,
  contactPerson: string,
  mobile: string,
  email: string,
  city: string,
  state: string,
  status: "Active" | "Inactive",
  students: number,
  teachers: number,
  classes: number,
  joinedDate: string,
  lastActive: string,
  subscriptionPlan: string,
  nextBilling: string,
  features: string[],
  recentActivity: Activity[]
}
```

### API Endpoints (To be implemented)

```javascript
// Schools
GET /api/owner/schools          // List all schools
POST /api/owner/schools         // Create new school
